1. Upload your file to a service like:
   - https://file.io/
   - https://tmpfiles.org/
   - https://0x0.st/
2. Copy the direct download link and paste it above

### Option 3: Your Own Hosting
1. Upload to your own web server, cloud storage, or file hosting
2. Ensure the URL provides direct access to the JSON file
3. Paste the URL above
